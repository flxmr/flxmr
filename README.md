Welcome to Felix Mayr's github!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graph neural networks for materials science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on Python packaging, some oldfashioned QT, and Rust for eventually controlling a (supposedly high quality) Infineon COâ‚‚-sensor
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool Open Data projects!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about running a small HPC on physical hardware and technology of past ages.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I will disassemble every broken electronics device before throwing it away.
